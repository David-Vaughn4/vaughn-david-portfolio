## Soldering Project
Over the course of a few days in class, I soldered the touch sensitive LED Owl soldering kit. This project included both surface mount soldering for a microchip and through-hole soldering for various electrical components including transistors, capacitors, and LEDs. Below are some progress photos for this project.

During this project, I luckily had no major setbacks, but did have to resolder a few of the LEDs after first testing it. This was due to a cold solder on one and solder bridges on a few others. Below is the project lit up in its three stages. These were fixed fairly easily though, and overall the project was very successful.

This project reinforced  the soldering skills I had already, but had not used in a while, allowing me to become a more efficent solderer.

## **GIT note
For some reason, I have been unable to add anyone else as a collaborator to my personal repository. I went through the settings, ensured it was public, that the email/username were typed correctly, and that my personal email was configured correctly, as well as going through ChatGPT's tips, but nothing seemed to work. **Fixed this by just creating a new account with a different email and copying everything into a new repository created on this new account from the old one.

# Capstone Project (Walking Table)
So far, I have been continuing the project me and Evan Park worked on last year. This year, I have been 3D-printing models to iterate more efficiently and isolate problems more effectively. This is the fusion model that I have been working off of:



So far I have gone through about 3 full iterations of legs. The first was too small and so the connectors (which replaced the nuts and bolts on the joints with the wooden models) wouldn't print correctly. After scaling everything up 200%, the second iteration still had the connectors too small and so in trying to put together the joints, they were too fragile and broke somewhat easily. This is that model:



Finally, I scaled the connector parts up relative to the size of the rest of the model and got the pieces below:



However, in its cycle, the parallel pieces of the leg came into contact (similar to what happened with the wooden pieces last year) and so made it decently harder to turn, an effect which would scale to be a major problem when many legs will be integrated together. To fix this, I printed thinner parallel pieces.
