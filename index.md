## Soldering Project
Over the course of a few days in class, I soldered the touch sensitive LED Owl soldering kit. This project included both surface mount soldering for a microchip and through-hole soldering for various electrical components including transistors, capacitors, and LEDs. Below are some progress photos for this project.

During this project, I luckily had no major setbacks, but did have to resolder a few of the LEDs after first testing it. This was due to a cold solder on one and solder bridges on a few others. Below is the project lit up in its three stages. These were fixed fairly easily though, and overall the project was very successful.

This project reinforced  the soldering skills I had already, but had not used in a while, allowing me to become a more efficent solderer.

## **GIT note
For some reason, I have been unable to add anyone else as a collaborator to my personal repository. I went through the settings, ensured it was public, that the email/username were typed correctly, and that my personal email was configured correctly, as well as going through ChatGPT's tips, but nothing seemed to work.
